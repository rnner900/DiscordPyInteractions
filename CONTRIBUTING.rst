Contributions
=============
Contributions to this open-source project are welcome and always appreciated! Every line of code helps
us ensure a better developed project to users. We will always credit those who help out.

New to contributing
-------------------
If you're new to contributing towards this project, we highly recommend starting off with installing
the library off of pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U discord-py-interactions[dev]

Once you have the library installed in Python, you are able to instantiate and run a basic bot
with a logging level that is set for debugging purposes. This is recommend in order to make it easier
for us to log certain events and procedures internally that may happen before, during or after an
error may be produced:

.. code-block:: python

    import interactions
    from logging import basicConfig, DEBUG

    basicConfig(level=DEBUG)

    bot = interactions.Client(token="...")

    bot.start()

Since we are an open-source project that unofficially supports the Discord API, we also respect
the `Code of Conduct`_ from their documentation.

Where to start
--------------
Our contributions start with an **Issue**. The issue should explain what the problem you're having is.
Issues are our way and methodology of tracking bugs that may be occurring with this library. Every contributor
is recommended to start with an Issue, as this helps numerous contributors and developers on various teams keep
track of requests, bugs and miscellaneous details.

Issue specifications
********************
Whenever there is an Issue created, they must follow the according criterion:

- An Issue must not be a duplicate of an existing one.
- A bug Issue must have all fields filled out.
- A request Issue must have support from a pre-determined amount of users.
- A miscellaneous Issue must:
    - Target a third-party repository if it is an issue correlated between the two.
    - Specify external issues that tie into library installation or performance.

Failure to comply to these factors will result in the Issue being closed with a comment and/or label.
Some Issues may be closed by the discretion of varying development teams for reasons that exclude
these factors.

Pull Request specifications
***************************
In order to create create in relevance to the issue, you start a **Pull Request**. Linking the issue in this
(known as a PR) allows us to easily identify what bugs have been correlated with the code requesting
to be changed in the source, and allow other developers to contribute where needed.

When a PR is made, you **must** be targeting the ``unstable`` branch. This is our development branch
that we use whenever we're working on any bug-fixing, breaking changes and/or overall new features. Our
development workflow for changes is from this branch to ``stable``, and then from there to a release.

A pull request must additionally adhere to these following requirements:

- Each git commit made on your fork must use `conventional commits`_.
- The pull request must be up-to-date with ``unstable`` before requesting a review.
- A ``pre-commit`` commit must exist and pass *all* checks before requesting a review.
- A review must be requested from at least one developer. Please target ``@interactions-py/core`` for this.

Recognizing contributors
------------------------
When a PR is successfully merged into one of the development branches, the GitHub user will automatically
be added to the contributor list of the repository. Additionally, at the discretion of the core development
team, it is possible to earn a role in our support server for contributors. (You will be notified if you are
eligible for this.) The git commit history on a file will also subsequently be updated by GitHub to include
your user signature.
