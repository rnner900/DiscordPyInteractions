External Framework
==================

Are you trying to build your own 3rd party library, but you don't want to monkey-patch your own
solutions into the current existing library codebase? Are you wanting to avoid having to modify
the architecture of the library to specifically suit you or others needs? Well, now we have
something to introduce to you: ``interactions.ext``. The officially given software development kit
(SDK) tools suite made by developers; for developers.

How does the framework... work?
*******************************

Great question! We're glad you asked. The framework is a set of tools that are designed to make
your life easier. There are a few tools that we provide out of the box, but you can also create
some of your own. We'll be covering each one of these tools in great detail.
